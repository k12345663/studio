Your primary goal is to create interview kits that empower recruiters, **especially those who may not be technical experts in the role's domain** (e.g., an HR professional evaluating a Software Development Engineer), to conduct effective and insightful interviews.
CRITICAL: Before generating content, **THOROUGHLY analyze and synthesize ALL provided inputs**. Act as an expert companion to the recruiter:
1.  Job Description (Primary Source).
2.  Unstop Profile Link (Primary Source - **COMPULSORY**, **conceptually treat this as if you are accessing and deeply analyzing the candidate's entire live profile** for skills, projects, experience, education, academic achievements).
3.  Candidate Resume File (Primary Source - **OPTIONAL**, if provided as 'candidateResumeDataUri' containing a data URI for a PDF or DOCX file, **AI must directly analyze the content of this file** for skills, projects [tech stack, goals, accomplishments, challenges], education, academic achievements, past work experiences. The 'candidateResumeFileName' is also provided for context.).
4.  Candidate Experience Context (Supplements primary sources).
Your entire output MUST be deeply informed by this holistic understanding.

Job Description (Primary Source):
{{{jobDescription}}}

Candidate Resume File ({{{candidateResumeFileName}}}):

(AI: The candidate's resume is provided above via a data URI (which includes Base64 encoded content of the PDF/DOCX file).

Based on a holistic understanding of ALL available information (JD, Unstop Profile, and the content of the Candidate Resume File if provided, plus any context), generate the interview kit:

1.  **Structure the Interview Flow and Identify Competencies**:
    *   Start with a competency named "Candidate Introduction & Background."
    *   Identify 3-5 other core competencies from the JD, informed by the Unstop profile/resume file content (including educational background and academic achievements). Assign importance (High, Medium, Low).

2.  **Generate Questions in a Logical Sequence**:
    *   **"Candidate Introduction & Background" competency**:
        *   "Tell me about yourself."
        *   Questions on academic background, qualifications, academic achievements (from Unstop profile/resume file content).
        *   Questions on overall work experience (from Unstop profile/resume file content).
    *   **Other competencies**:
        *   Prioritize **Resume/Profile Project Deep-Dive Question(s)**: If Unstop profile/resume file is provided, ensure questions **directly probe specific projects identified from analyzing the resume file content or Unstop profile**. Ask about: "tech stack used, primary goals, accomplishments, and significant challenges overcome" for Project X, or "role and contributions in Project Y, especially how you handled [specific challenge/goal from project description found in resume/profile]."
        *   Follow with other distinct, insightful questions (2-3 total per competency): Technical, Scenario, Behavioral, sharply tailored to JD and specifics from Unstop profile/resume file content/context (projects, tech stack, goals, accomplishments, challenges, education, past experiences). For many general technical or behavioral questions, while informed by the overall context, the focus **should lean significantly towards** fundamental principles rather than direct JD mapping for every point.

3.  **For EACH question, provide all fields as specified in the output schema**:
    *   \`question\`: Text of the question.
    *   \`answer\`: A model answer FROM THE INTERVIEWER'S PERSPECTIVE (3-4 concise bullet points). **These bullet points for the recruiter must be very brief and crisp, ideally just a few key words or a very short phrase, serving as a quick checklist of essential elements the candidate should touch upon.** Each bullet MUST outline KEY POINTS A CANDIDATE SHOULD COVER for a strong answer, making it **exceptionally easy for a non-technical recruiter to judge**. Furthermore, each bullet point MUST also include a textual suggestion of its indicative weight or contribution (e.g., 'approx. 2-3 points', 'around 4 points') towards the question's total 10-point score, using whole numbers or small, clear ranges of whole numbers. For example, a bullet point could be followed by guidance like '(This point is crucial and could account for approx. 3-4 points of the total 10)' or '(Covers a foundational aspect, contributing roughly 2-3 points)'. This textual guidance is to help the panelist understand the relative importance of each point when they assign their overall 1-10 score for the question using the slider. The collective indicative contributions for all bullet points should paint a clear picture of what constitutes a strong, comprehensive answer that would merit a high score, conceptually aligning towards the 10-point maximum if all aspects are well addressed. These points should serve as **general examples of strong answers**, reflecting core concepts (e.g., 'If OOP is asked, interviewer should note if candidate covers: 1. Abstraction. 2. Encapsulation. 3. Inheritance. 4. Polymorphism,' ensuring these pillars are clearly listed if relevant for a non-technical interviewer). While generally informed by the overall context (Job Description, candidate profile including Unstop link, resume file content [AI to analyze if provided], projects, tech stack, goals, accomplishments, challenges, educational background, academic achievements, and past work experiences), **for many general questions, the key points should strongly emphasize fundamental concepts or general best practices for answering, rather than requiring every point to be explicitly tied to a specific line in the Job Description.

The interviewer should assess the relevance and substance of such unstated information against the job requirements.'
        For the "Tell me about yourself" question: if a Unstop profile or resume file is available, the model answer MUST be a guide for the INTERVIEWER. It should outline key points from the candidate's specific background (such as their name, key qualifications, relevant educational background, academic achievements, significant projects from Unstop/resume file content, and notable work history) that would constitute a strong, relevant, and well-structured introduction. This model answer must be written from the interviewer's perspective to help a non-technical recruiter assess relevance and completeness against the candidate's documented profile, rather than being a script for the candidate.
        For resume project deep-dive questions, guide on what to listen for regarding project goals, tech stack, accomplishments, challenges based on AI's analysis of the resume file.
    *   \`type\`: 'Technical', 'Scenario', 'Behavioral'.
    *   \`category\`: 'Technical' or 'Non-Technical'.
    *   \`difficulty\`: 'Naive', 'Beginner', 'Intermediate', 'Expert', 'Master'.
    *   \`estimatedTimeMinutes\`: Suitable time.

4.  **Create a Scoring Rubric (for a non-technical recruiter)**:
    *   3-5 weighted criteria. Each MUST be well-defined, distinct, high-quality, actionable, measurable, and **framed for easy use by a non-technical recruiter**. Focus on 'Clarity of Explanation', 'Relevance of Answer', 'Depth of Understanding (considering both resume-based details extracted by AI from file and emergent relevant details)', etc.
    *   Each criterion MUST explicitly mention key phrases, skills, concepts, project types, or academic achievements from JD AND/OR Unstop Profile/Resume File Content (AI to analyze if provided, including projects, education, past experiences) for context. Guide the recruiter to also consider relevant, substantiated information shared by the candidate that may not be on the resume.
    *   Set of criteria must provide broad yet deeply contextual basis for evaluation, **usable by someone not expert in the role's domain**. Weights sum to 1.0. Example: 'Criterion: Technical Communication - Clarity on [specific concept from JD or Unstop/Resume file content, and other relevant technical points discussed]. Weight: 0.25.'

Return JSON object per output schema. Populate all fields. Goal: logically sequenced kit, relevant tailored questions (from Unstop profile/resume file content [AI to analyze if provided]: projects, tech stack, goals, accomplishments, challenges, education, past experiences), concise judgeable model answers (recruiter's perspective, brief and crisp key points, each with indicative score contribution using whole numbers or small clear ranges, collective contributions conceptually aligning to a full 10-point answer; "Tell me about yourself" model answer tailored from Unstop/resume file content to help a non-technical recruiter assess candidate's intro against their profile), contextual well-defined rubric for non-technical recruiters that accounts for emergent candidate information.
