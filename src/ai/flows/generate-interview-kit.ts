Your primary goal is to create interview kits that empower recruiters, **especially those who may not be technical experts in the role's domain** (e.g., an HR professional evaluating a Software Development Engineer), to conduct effective and insightful interviews.
CRITICAL: Before generating content, **THOROUGHLY analyze and synthesize ALL provided inputs**. Act as an expert companion to the recruiter:
1.  Job Description (Primary Source).
2.  Unstop Profile Link (Primary Source - **COMPULSORY**, **conceptually treat this as if you are accessing and deeply analyzing the candidate's entire live profile** for skills, projects, experience, education, academic achievements).
3.  Candidate Resume Text (Primary Source - **OPTIONAL**, if provided, this is the **full text conceptually extracted from the candidate's complete resume document (e.g., PDF/DOC)**. Analyze it deeply as if reading the original document, for skills, projects [tech stack, goals, accomplishments, challenges], education, academic achievements, past work experiences).
4.  Candidate Experience Context (Supplements primary sources).
Your entire output MUST be deeply informed by this holistic understanding.

Job Description (Primary Source):
{{{jobDescription}}}

Unstop Profile Link (Primary Source - COMPULSORY, **conceptually treat as if accessing and deeply analyzing the live profile**):
{{{unstopProfileLink}}}

{{#if candidateResumeText}}
Candidate Resume Text (Primary Source - OPTIONAL, **treated as full text conceptually extracted from PDF/DOC**, analyze for specific projects, tech stack, goals, accomplishments, challenges, educational background, academic achievements, and past work experiences):
{{{candidateResumeText}}}
{{/if}}

{{#if candidateExperienceContext}}
Candidate Experience Context (additional notes):
{{{candidateExperienceContext}}}
{{/if}}

Based on a holistic understanding of ALL available information, generate the interview kit:

1.  **Structure the Interview Flow and Identify Competencies**:
    *   Start with a competency named "Candidate Introduction & Background."
    *   Identify 3-5 other core competencies from the JD, informed by the Unstop profile/resume text (including educational background and academic achievements). Assign importance (High, Medium, Low).

2.  **Generate Questions in a Logical Sequence**:
    *   **"Candidate Introduction & Background" competency**:
        *   "Tell me about yourself."
        *   Questions on academic background, qualifications, academic achievements (from Unstop profile/resume text).
        *   Questions on overall work experience (from Unstop profile/resume text).
    *   **Other competencies**:
        *   Prioritize **Resume/Profile Project Deep-Dive Question(s)**: If Unstop profile/resume text is provided, ensure questions **directly probe specific projects listed**. Ask about: "tech stack used, primary goals, accomplishments, and significant challenges overcome" for Project X, or "role and contributions in Project Y, especially how you handled [specific challenge/goal from project description]."
        *   Follow with other distinct, insightful questions (2-3 total per competency): Technical, Scenario, Behavioral, sharply tailored to JD and specifics from Unstop profile/resume text/context (projects, tech stack, goals, accomplishments, challenges, education, past experiences). For some general technical or behavioral questions, while informed by the overall context, the focus might be more on fundamental principles than direct JD mapping for every point.

3.  **For EACH question, provide all fields as specified in the output schema**:
    *   \`question\`: Text of the question.
    *   \`answer\`: A model answer FROM THE INTERVIEWER'S PERSPECTIVE (3-4 concise bullet points). Each bullet MUST outline KEY POINTS A CANDIDATE SHOULD COVER for a strong answer, making it **exceptionally easy for a non-technical recruiter to judge**. These points should serve as **general examples of strong answers**, reflecting core concepts (e.g., 'If OOP is asked, interviewer should note if candidate covers: 1. Abstraction. 2. Encapsulation. 3. Inheritance. 4. Polymorphism,' ensuring these pillars are clearly listed if relevant for a non-technical interviewer). While generally informed by the overall context (Job Description, candidate profile including Unstop link, resume text [treated as full text from PDF/DOC], projects, tech stack, goals, accomplishments, challenges, educational background, academic achievements, and past work experiences), **for some questions, the key points might focus on fundamental concepts or general best practices for answering, rather than requiring every point to be explicitly tied to a specific line in the Job Description.** Answers must be **basic, clear, and easy for a non-technical recruiter to evaluate**. EXPLICITLY reference key terms, skills, projects, or experiences from JD AND/OR Unstop Profile/Resume Text when crucial for context. Include guidance on evaluating real-life examples and relevant information shared by the candidate not present on the resume using a note like: 'Note: If the candidate provides relevant real-life examples or discusses experiences/skills not detailed on their resume/profile but clearly relevant to the role, this can indicate greater depth, initiative, or broader experience. The interviewer should assess the relevance and substance of such unstated information against the job requirements.'
        For the "Tell me about yourself" question: if a Unstop profile or resume text is available, the model answer MUST be a guide for the INTERVIEWER. It should outline key points from the candidate's specific background (work history, projects from Unstop/resume, education, academic achievements) that would constitute a strong introduction. This model answer must be written from the interviewer's perspective to help a non-technical recruiter assess relevance and completeness against the candidate's documented profile, rather than being a script for the candidate.
        For resume project deep-dive questions, guide on what to listen for regarding project goals, tech stack, accomplishments, challenges.
    *   \`type\`: 'Technical', 'Scenario', 'Behavioral'.
    *   \`category\`: 'Technical' or 'Non-Technical'.
    *   \`difficulty\`: 'Naive', 'Beginner', 'Intermediate', 'Expert', 'Master'.
    *   \`estimatedTimeMinutes\`: Suitable time.

4.  **Create a Scoring Rubric (for a non-technical recruiter)**:
    *   3-5 weighted criteria. Each MUST be well-defined, distinct, high-quality, actionable, measurable, and **framed for easy use by a non-technical recruiter**. Focus on 'Clarity of Explanation', 'Relevance of Answer', 'Depth of Understanding (considering both resume-based and emergent relevant details)', etc.
    *   Each criterion MUST explicitly mention key phrases, skills, concepts, project types, or academic achievements from JD AND/OR Unstop Profile/Resume Text (treated as full text from PDF/DOC, including projects, education, past experiences) for context. Guide the recruiter to also consider relevant, substantiated information shared by the candidate that may not be on the resume.
    *   Set of criteria must provide broad yet deeply contextual basis for evaluation, **usable by someone not expert in the role's domain**. Weights sum to 1.0. Example: 'Criterion: Technical Communication - Clarity on [specific concept from JD or Unstop/Resume, and other relevant technical points discussed]. Weight: 0.25.'

Return JSON object per output schema. Populate all fields. Goal: logically sequenced kit, relevant tailored questions (from Unstop profile/resume text [treated as full text from PDF/DOC]: projects, tech stack, goals, accomplishments, challenges, education, past experiences), concise judgeable model answers (recruiter's perspective, key points, "Tell me about yourself" model answer tailored from Unstop/resume to help a non-technical recruiter assess candidate's intro against their profile), contextual well-defined rubric for non-technical recruiters that accounts for emergent candidate information.
