# **App Name**: InterviewAI

## Core Features:

- Competency Extraction: Extract core competencies from a job description using AI. It serves as a tool that will identify the key skills, tools, and business outcomes to create targeted questions.
- Question Generation: Generate technical, scenario-based, and behavioral interview questions tailored to each competency. It serves as a tool which follows a specific framework to produce a well-rounded set of questions for each competency.
- Model Answer Creation: Provide model answers for each generated question to guide interviewers. The AI will produce concise exemplar answers, setting a clear benchmark for interviewers.
- Scoring Rubric Generation: Create a scoring rubric with weighted criteria for fair evaluation. The AI will generate 4-5 criteria with explicit weights that sum to 1.0, providing a structured evaluation framework.
- Accordion Display: Display generated questions and answers in an accordion format for easy navigation. The UI should render the questions and answers in a clear, collapsible structure.
- Panelist Scoring: Allow panelists to input scores and notes during interviews. Include a scoring slider from 1-5, allow input to persist the values, and add fields for personal notes to retain during the interview process.
- Customization Options: Enable recruiters to tweak question wording and re-weight criteria as needed. Recruiters must be able to edit the model responses. Implement a regenerate feature, which calls the AI a second time to edit/re-generate the question.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate blue (#5F9EA0), providing a calming, competent and reliable aesthetic.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F8FF), almost imperceptible, very desaturated hue near that of slate blue. Lays quietly beneath more saturated colors.
- Accent color: Dusty lavender (#A588B5). Its slight difference from slate blue allows for interface contrast that subtly draws attention to elements on the page, like buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for its modern, neutral, and objective appearance, ensuring legibility and a clean aesthetic across all text elements.
- Use simple, professional icons to represent different competencies and question types.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout with clear section headings and consistent spacing.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without being distracting.
